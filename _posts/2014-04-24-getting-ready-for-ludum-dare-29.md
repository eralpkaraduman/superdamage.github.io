Wow this is the first post.

This time we are taking Ludum Dare even more seriously. Actually we are taking everything seriously, I mean look at this.. we have a web site.
It's built on Jekyll and serving on github where our every open source project will live in.

To get ready for this weekend, I've read some stuff about new Phaser 2. Used it's yeoman project generator which is awesome. Got this blog/site thing working. Got dipped into some ruby shit, mavericks installation problems but I don't regret. I've even installed gcc on mavericks just becouse some blog post said it's necessary to install "RedCloth". I hate almost everythins name in the ruby-world. WTF is RedCloth, why not name it RubyDependencyCompiler (I don't know what it's for, this is my best shot).

Phew, this site better be worth it, I spent (lost) hours to get it working. Of course I could just open a tumblr an get on with it but.. This is not the way hipsters go man. Can't help it, I cant sleep when everything i do is little bit hipstery (in software-dev terms btw, I dont ride a unicycle to work).
